		<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>I hold an Active TS/SCI with CI Polygraph, granted on December 5th, 2019.
			<p>I worked as a Data Engineer at USINDOPACOM JIOC in Hawaii, primarily using Python for data analysis, although I also utilized PERL, R (with the tidyverse tools), and SQL (mainly Microsoft SQL Server). To visualize data, I utilized various tools including Google Earth, Tableau, Power BI, Microsoft Excel, and ArcGIS.

			<p>I have worked as a Data Analyst at the DOD Center in Seaside, California, using all the aforementioned tools, in addition to Excel for data analysis and comparisons.</p>
			<p>With over 26 years of Intelligence Analysis and three years of experience as an IT Manager in the Navy, totaling over 28 years of service, I am seeking opportunities to leverage my programming and IT skills.</p>
